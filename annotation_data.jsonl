More than 2.7 million miles of pipelines transport natural gas, oil, and other hazardous liquids that U.S. citizens and businesses depend on to operate vehicles and machinery, heat homes, generate electricity, and manufacture products. Given that many pipelines transport volatile, flammable, or toxic oil and liquids, and given the potential consequences of a successful physical or cyber-attack, pipeline systems are attractive targets for terrorists, hackers, foreign nations, criminal groups, and others with malicious intent. TSA, within the Department of Homeland Security, has primary oversight responsibility for the physical security and cybersecurity of transmission and distribution pipeline systems. This testimony summarizes findings from GAO's December 2018 report examining TSA's management of its pipeline security program. In addition, this statement contains updates from TSA as of April 2019 about actions it has taken to address the recommendations made in the December 2018 GAO report. For this report, GAO reviewed and analyzed relevant documents from TSA and other federal entities, evaluated TSA pipeline risk assessment efforts, and interviewed TSA officials, including officials within TSA's Pipeline Security Branch.

For example, TSA developed a Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool in 2007 to assess various security risks to the top 100 pipeline systems based on volume of material transported through the system (throughput). The risk ranking tool calculates threat, vulnerability, and consequence for each pipeline system on variables such as the amount of throughput in the pipeline system and the number of critical facilities using data collected from pipeline operators, as well as other federal agencies such as TSA. However, in its December 2018 GAO report GAO found that the last time TSA calculated relative risk using the ranking tool was in 2014.

The VCF was first established by Title IV of the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (ATSSA; P.L. 107-42) in September 2001 to compensate persons injured or the representatives of persons killed in the attacks or their immediate aftermath. The original VCF received 7,403 claims and made awards totaling $7.049 billion to 5,560 claimants. It was closed to new claims in December 2003, due to concerns about injuries and illnesses incurred by persons involved in emergency response, recovery, and debris removal operations at the September11th aircraft crash sites. Congress subsequently reauthorized the VCF with the enactment of Title II of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Zadrogas Act; PHL. 111-347). The reopened VCF extended eligibility for cash benefits up to $2.775 billion to persons who suffered physical injuries or illnesses as a result of rescue or recovery or who were present at or near the sites from September 11 to May 30, 2002. Total benefits and administrative costs were limited by the $2.,775-million cap on total payments. Under the original VCA, unlike in the current VCF, there was no cap on the amount of benefits that any one person could receive or on total benefits paid. To be eligible for VCF benefits, a person must have died as a passenger or crew member on one of the aircraft hijacked on September 11; died as the direct result of the terrorist related aircraft crashes or rescue, recovery or debris removal in the immediate aftermath of September 11: or was present at a September 11 crash site in the immediately aftermath of those attacks; or suffered physical harm as a direct result from the crashes or the immediate aftermath.

According to NOAA, many of the agency's activities are related to restoration and conservation projects; the projects are typically local or regional in scale and take place within coastal or Great Lakes states. NOAA defines nature based and related infrastructure as \"engineered systems where natural features are combined with more hard or structural engineering approaches to create a hybrid system.\" According to the agency, various types of nature based or related infrastructure include open lands and trees, bulkheads, living shorelines, and coral reefs, among others. The nature of infrastructure is partially dependent on the location and type of features used. The extent to which nature based features provide benefits in addition to flood, erosion, and runoff management, such as improved water quality, wildlife habitat, opportunity for groundwater recharge, recreation uses, and aesthetic appeal, is also dependent on a variety of factors, including funding, space constraints, and other factors. Congress has not defined in statute nature based, or related terms for NOAA, nor has it explicitly directed NOAA to broadly support nature based activities across the agency. For example, the term living shoreline for the use within a new agency-administered grant program has not been defined. Congress may consider whether and how to define the term and the types of natural-based infrastructure for NOAA. A NOAA-specific definition of natural infrastructure and similar terms in statute may help the agency prioritize and manage its nature-oriented infrastructure activities.

While these restrictions are no longer in place, questions remain about what the CCC does, how it operates, what its current uses are, and what it may be used for in the future. CCCC is, in brief, a broadly empowered financial institution. The money CCC needs to operate comes from its own funds (including its $100 million capital stock, appropriations from Congress, and its earnings) and from borrowings. Most CCC-funded programs are classified as mandatory spending programs, and therefore do not require annual appropriations in order to operate. The corporation instead borrows from the Treasury to finance its programs. As the amount of money needed for CCC activities has grown over time, the borrowing limit has been steadily increased. At present, CCC borrowing authority is limited to $30 billion, an amount that has not been increased since 1987. CSCC is often described as using two different but different measures. The first is net expenditures, which is a combination of outlays and receipts. The second is net realized losses, which refers to the money that CCC will never recover (e.g., interest paid to the Treasury, program payments, program costs, and fees, and program and commodity inventory). The corporation's permanent, indefinite funding authority means that trade aid expenditures are reimbursed annually as a net realized loss, thus increasing total federal spending.

GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 15 high-dollar value State/Inl projects and five high-value USAID projects that started between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, some of which were still ongoing as of September 30, 2019, or later. The value of the 15 State projects in our sample is about $88 million, and USAID funded 57 projects. GAO rated the agencies' monitoring of these 20 projects against eight key project monitoring practices, largely derived from leading practices for monitoring foreign assistance that GAO had previously identified. On the basis of our review, we assessed whether the key practices were \u201cgenerally followed,\u201d \u201cpartially followed,\u201d or \u201cnot followed.\u201d We rated the extent, if any of the critical elements of the key practice were conducted and documented, to a large or full extent, and \u201cnot tracked\u201d if we did not receive evidence that any of these critical elements were conducted or documented. GAO also reviewed data from Mexico on M\u00e9rida projects and found that State and INL used data from this country to track project performance.

Since fiscal year 2008, the United States has allocated about $3 billion for assistance for Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative, a bilateral partnership that aims to address serious challenges to security and the rule of law. State/INL and USAID are the lead U.S. agencies for developing the initiative's programming. GAO was asked to review issues related to the implementation and objectives of the M\u00e9ridida Initiative. This report (1) examines the extent to which State follows key monitoring practices and tracks project performance data against established measures; (2) examines State's monitoring and tracks performance data; and (3) describes how State uses data from the Government of Mexico to help monitor the implementation of M\u00e9rIDA Initiative projects.

GAOsborne also reviewed State/INA's monitoring of the 15 projects' latest annual reports.What GAO Found. The Department of State's (State) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (State/INA) generally followed eight key practices for monitoring foreign assistance projects GAO reviewed about half of the time. These practices are generally consistent with the Office of Management and Budget's guidelines for Federal departments and agencies that administer United States foreign assistance and related guidance, as well as State's and the U. S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) monitoring policies. State generally followed each of the key monitoring practice related to three aspects of monitoring projects: assigning monitoring duties to qualified staff, planning a monitoring approach, and monitoring project implementation. For example, State generally assigned monitoring duties and generally planned a monitored project implementation approach about two-thirds of time.

This report (1) examines the extent to which the Department of State (State), Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (State/INL) follows key practices in monitoring Civil Security Agreements projects and tracks project performance data against established measures; (2) examines the degree to which State follows key monitoring practices and tracks performance data; and (3) describes how State uses data from the Government of Mexico to help monitor the implementation of Civil Security Orders. GAO reviewed relevant State and USAID documents and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C., and Mexico City.What GAO Found. State generally followed key practices for monitoring foreign assistance projects about half of the time, but did not consistently track performance data or compare them to established measures for a subset of four selected projects. For example, State did not track performance for two of the four selected programs and tracked such data inconsistently for the other two projects. Consistently following key practices would allow State to stay well informed of projects' performance, take corrective action when necessary, and help ensure that projects achieve their intended results. For projects GAO reviewed, State followed eight key practices, including assigning monitoring duties to qualified staff, planning a monitoring approach, and monitoring project implementation. GAO found that State followed the practices about half the time for 15 of these projects, and for a nongeneralizable subset of the 20 projects, it did not follow the practices for four projects.

In light of the resulting pandemic and warnings about the risks of air travel, U.S. passenger airline traffic fell by 96 percent in April 2020, as compared to April 2019. COVID-19 is only the latest communicable disease to raise concerns about the spread of contagion through air travel.

This statement is based on GAO's prior work and interviews with DOT officials.What GAO Found. In 2015, GAO found that the United States lacked a comprehensive national aviation preparedness plan to limit the spread and spread of communicable illnesses through air transportation, though some individual airport and airline preparedness plans did exist. Accordingly, we recommended that DOT work with the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Homeland Security (DHS) to develop such a plan. As of June 2020, DOT, DHS, and HHS stated that the federal government still has not developed a national plan. DOT and FAA have stronger and deeper ties to, as well as oversight responsibility for, the relevant stakeholders that would be most involved in such a broad effort, namely airlines, airports, and other aviation stakeholders. In response to the current COVID--19 pandemic and in the absence of a comprehensive plan, DOT officials pointed to ongoing efforts to engage with interagency partners at DHS and HHS, as, well as industry stakeholders, to better collaborate on the aviation sector's communicable-disease response and preparedness.

The Navy's VH-92A program is to replace the aging presidential helicopter fleet, which has been in service for several decades. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2014 included a provision for GAO to report on the Presidential Helicopter program annually until the Navy awards a contract for full-rate production, currently planned for 2021. In this report, GAO discusses (1) the extent to which the program is meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals and (2) challenges, if any, the program has experienced in developmental testing and in producing aircraft and plans for addressing the challenges. To conduct this work, GAOs compared cost estimates and program milestones established at the start of development to current estimates and milestone dates. GAO also examined and analyzed key acquisition documents including contractor monthly status reports, earned value management data, and Defense Contract Management Agency reports to determine the performance and cost status of the development effort.What GAO Found. The VH\u201392A presidential helicopter program is on track to meet the Navy's original cost and schedule estimates for development, but it is behind schedule. The program is about $1.2 billion behind schedule and $1 billion behind budget. The cost estimate for development is $2.1 billion more than originally estimated in 2005, and the schedule is $3.1 million more than initially estimated in 2009. The schedule is also about $600 million more behind budget because the program did not meet its schedule baseline for development. In addition, the schedule baseline does not reflect the Navy plans to deliver the aircraft to the Department of Defense (DOD) in fiscal year 2020 as originally planned. The prime contractor has experienced delays in delivering the first two prototype aircraft, and has not delivered the first three production aircraft to DOD as planned. These delays are due in part to the program's decision to use a modified version of an existing aircraft to begin development rather than the development of a new aircraft.

The Prime Contractor and the program office have taken steps to address these challenges, but more work is needed to address them. For instance, PMO officials stated that they are taking steps to develop a new avionics system that will be integrated into the aircraft and that they plan to begin production in fiscal year 2020. PMO also stated that it is working with Sikorsky to address the challenges associated with the development and production of the executive cabin interior. However, the Prime Contractor has not yet fully implemented the acquisition strategy and has not developed a plan to fully integrate the executive interior. PMO is also not developing a strategy to fully address the development, production, and testing of the avionics system.

The Coast Guard's Office of Commercial Vessel Compliance (OCV) oversees the implementation of SMS plans and conducts SMS compliance audits at the company level and aboard each vessel. The Hamm Alert Maritime Safety Act of 2018 includes a provision that GAO review the implementation and effectiveness of Coast Guard oversight and enforcement and evaluate the effectiveness of the plans to address the impact of heavy weather. This report addresses (1) how the Coast Guard verifies that domestic vessels' SMS plans comply with federal regulations, and (2) the extent to which the 12 SMS plans GAO reviewed identify potential shipboard emergencies and include applicable response procedures. GAO reviewed relevant Coast Guard regulations, policies, and guidance; analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 domestic commercial SMS plans representing five different vessel types; and interviewed Coast Guard officials.What GAO Found. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) verifies domestic commercial vessel SMS plans as part of its overall vessel compliance activities, such as conducting annual inspections of applicable U. S.-flagged vessels. In particular, the Coast Guards verifies that SMS plans are compliant with applicable regulations and conduct related oversight of third parties (ROs) responsible for SMS certifications and associated audits. Among their responsibilities, ROs are to coordinate with vessel operators to review SMS plans, issue applicable vessel certificates, and conduct SMS compliance audit activities at the vessel level. Coast Guards conduct SMS audits on a case-by-case basis, and ROs review SMS audits to identify deficiencies and take applicable enforcement actions. In addition, the USCG verifies that ROs have documented SMS compliance during vessel inspections. The USCG has taken positive steps to enhance oversight of ROs since the EL FARO incident. In 2018, the USCG established a new group to monitor ROs, developed new SMS-related guidance and associated work instructions, increased direct observations, developed key performance indicators, and developed guidance to request internal investigations for certain RO deficiencies.

Although the Air Force has been working on improving its risk management and internal control practices, including remediation of deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting identified during its financial statement audit process, it still faces significant challenges. In July 2016, OMB issued an updated Circular No. A-123, which requires executive agencies to implement enterprise risk management (ERM) in their management practices. ERM is a management tool that can help leaders anticipate and manage risks that could affect the achievement of an agency's objectives as well as consider how multiple risks, when examined as a whole, can present even greater challenges and opportunities. GAO's objectives were to determine the extent to which Air Force (1) incorporated ERM in its management practices and (2) designed an approach for assessing internal control, including processes related to mission- critical assets.

For example, the framework includes elements such as identifying and prioritizing risks, assessing risks as an interrelated portfolio rather than addressing risks one by one, and identifying and assessing the impact of risks on agency objectives. The framework also includes elements related to risk identification and mitigation, risk assessment, and risk mitigation. However, it does not include all elements necessary to implement ERM.

The Air Force is a component of DOD and is required to (1) identify and manage risks, (2) establish and operate an effective internal control system, (3) assess and correct control deficiencies, and (4) report on the effectiveness of internal control through an annual Statement of Assurance. A-123, issued under the authority of FMFIA, requires executive agencies to evaluate the risks to accomplishing their strategic, operations, reporting, and compliance objectives and to provide an annual statement of assurance that represents the agency head's informed judgment as to the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the agency's internal control. GAO was asked to review the Air Force's management practices related to internal control, including processes related to mission-critical assets. This report addresses the extent to which the AirF (1) incorporated ERM in its management practices and (2) designed an approach for assessing internal control that includes the processes associated with mission critical assets.

GAO also interviewed GSA officials.What GAO Found. Selected stakeholders identified several aspects of GSA leases that can affect cost and compete, and GSA has some steps to address these concerns. These stakeholders identified the eight most commonly mentioned requirements and the most commonly cited areas of GSA's leasing process based on responses from both lessor groups and brokers. They also identified a number of aspects of these leases that they said can affect their costs and the number of lessor who are willing and able to bid on a GSA lease. These areas were: Structure: overall characteristics of a lease including the volume and complexity of requirements, and how GSA structures rent payments, reimbursements for tenant improvements, and provision of services; Requirements: specific provisions in the lease such as early termination, janitorial and maintenance, tenant substitution, and real property taxes; and Process: the steps lessor must follow to complete a GSAlease. Stakeholders identified the GSA leases' process as Modernization Cost and Competition. The stakeholders also said that the way GSA structures aspects of its leases can affect costs and competition. For example, one-third of the stakeholders GAO spoke with said GSA may lead lessor to increase their bid prices to account for real estate tax uncertainty. GSA does not have complete information to address stakeholder concerns, as it has continued its industry outreach efforts.

To address each of these questions, GAO analyzed FAMS data and documents, visited six FAMS field offices selected to capture variation in, among other things, types of missions, number of schedule changes, and number of complaints, and interviewed FAMS officials.What GAO Found. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) has had initiatives in place to assess air marshaled's health, but has not been as comprehensive in its efforts to assess individual air marshall's health as it has been in the past. For example, since 2004 FAMS\u2014an office within TSA\u2014has required air marshalls to obtain a medical examination at least every 2 years and has operated a Health, Fitness, and Wellness Program and a Hearing Conservation Program to help ensure air marshlsthat they meet its medical standards. In addition, since 2015 FAMS (which is now called the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association) has operated two health and fitness programs. However, Fams maintains limited health information on air marshali's in a data system. Specifically, FAM has not entered air marshalla's medical information, including their medical qualification status, into this system because such information is protected by law and is not suitable to maintain in this way. Instead, FAMA maintains the results of the medical exams\u2014including their qualification status\u2014in paper files. In the absence of a comprehensive data system to maintain medical information about air marshan's health and work schedules, FAMI relies on its medical staff to monitor air marshally's work hours and rest periods and to develop scheduling guidelines and protocols. However FAMS does not have a comprehensive set of scheduling guidelines"}}, {"a1": {"relevance_score": 0.65, "factual_score": 0.8571428571428572, "sentence_error_list": ["The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) has had initiatives in place to assess air marshaled's (air marshal) health, but has not comprehensively assessed the health of the workforce as a whole.

However, while FAMS monitors certain information on workers' compensation claims and has plans to further monitor workplace injuries, it has not used or planned to use other information it collects to assess the health of its workforce in a comprehensive manner that would enable it to look for broader health trends and risks. In November 2018, FAMS management officials stated that understanding the overall health and wellness of the FAMS workforce is paramount. Without information on the health and fitness of the entire workforce, FPSS management is not well positioned to prioritize employee health and welfare or ensure that it deploys a workforce capable of fulfilling its national security mission. FPSS employees filed 230 discrimination complaints with the Transportation Security Administration's Civil Rights Division (CRD) in fiscal years 2016 through 2018, though employees may have reported additional discrimination complaints through other means. FPS's management has taken some steps to prevent or reduce discrimination, but has not fully implemented various efforts in future years. FPS has not updated its 2012 action plan to strengthen its efforts to address and reduce discrimination. FPS management has not assessed the health or fitness of its entire workforce by analyzing available data, which would allow it to identify any health and health fitness trends or risks among its workforce, take steps to mitigate these risks, make informed workforce planning decisions, and prioritize employee welfare to ensure that its workforce is capable of meeting its mission. FAMS does not monitor the extent that air marshal work hours are consistent with scheduling guidelines, limiting its ability to determine if air marshal quality is being balanced with the agency's operational needs.

The eight programs reviewed by GAO identified improper payment root cause analysis and corrective action plan requirements under the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) and related Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. However, the agencies did not fully adhere to these requirements or OMB guidance. For example, all of the programs did not identify the root causes for all of their reported improper payments, and none of the agencies documented the actions taken to correct those causes in their corrective actions. In addition, all eight programs did identify the causes of some improper payments identified in their programs, but did not document the actions that were taken to address those improper payments. OMB requires agencies to report on the results of corrective actions in their annual financial statements, but does not require agencies to document the completion dates of those actions. Without clearly documenting the actions to be completed, agencies may not be able to determine whether the corrective actions have resulted in the elimination of improper or non-improper payments.

The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, as amended (IPIA), and related Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, direct agencies to identify root causes of improper payments, develop corresponding corrective actions, and communicate related information to appropriate stakeholders. GAO was asked to review agencies' improper payment root cause analysis and corrective action plan processes. This report examines (1) actions agencies have taken to identify and address root causes for improper payments for selected programs, (2) the extent to which their corrective actions correspond to identified root causes, and (3) the level to which agencies monitored the progress and evaluated the effectiveness of their corrective action plans.

For example, the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) uses data from the most recent detailed Internal Revenue Service compliance study to identify reported SNAP improper payments. The Department of the Treasury's Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a tax credit that offsets taxes owed by eligible taxpayers, and EITC recipients need not owe taxes to receive a benefit.

For instance, Education developed a corrective action to address each of the six major root causes identified for its Direct Loan and Pell Grant programs, and VA developed a process for identifying and implementing related corrective actions. The four agencies, however, did not develop agency-level corrective actions to address SNAP's root causes.

Improper travel payments\u2014payments that should not have been made or were made in an incorrect amount\u2014are a long-standing, significant problem in the federal government, estimated at about $151 billion for fiscal year 2018. DOD's travel pay program has been challenged by inaccurate and inconsistent estimates of improper payment rates that do not allow for reliably tracking the rate of improper travel payments over time. Due, in part, to the DODIG's findings, in October 2016, DOD developed a DOD Travel Pay Improper Payments Remediation Plan to reinforce internal controls and accountability and help reduce improper payments. GAO conducted this work under the authority of the Comptroller General to assist Congress with its oversight responsibilities. This report examines (1) the amount DOD spent on DTS travel payments for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and how much of those payments DOD estimated to be improper; (2) the extent to which DOD has implemented its Remediated Plan; and (3) the establishment of mechanisms to identify errors leading to improper travel payment errors, the root causes of those errors, and the cost-effectiveness of addressing them. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed DOD travel payment data, policies, and guidance, and conducted a web-based survey of travel administrators in 52 DOD components that manage travel payments processed by DOD's DTS.What GAO Found. Using data provided by the Department of Defense's (DOD) Defense Travel System (DTS), GAO calculated that DOD spent an average of $6. The Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO), the department's primary system used to process travel payments, reported $18. The largest portion of those travel payments was for active duty servicemembers, who accounted for $9.5 billion (52 percent) of the total amount of travel payments. According to DTS data, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) estimated that $965.5 million (or 5.3 percent ) of those total travel payments were improper.

DOD selected 10 components to include on a committee that was established to monitor implementation of its Remingiation Plan, but it did not consider components' improper payment rates as part of its selection process. As a result, DOD may have excluded some components with relatively lower travel payments but higher rates of improper payments.

widely used operation in digital signal processing algorithms and plays a significant role in numerous signal processing applications, such as image processing, speech processing, software defined

number of stage of fft computation increases with a factor of @xmath0. in the design of high throughput fft architectures, energy - efficient design techniques can be used to maximize performance under power dissipation constraints.  spatial and parallel fft architecture, also known as array architecture, based on the cooley - tukey algorithm layout, is one of the potential high throughput designs.  however, the implementation of the array architecture is hardware intensive.  it achieves high performance by using spatial parallelism, while requiring more routing resources.  however, as the problem size grows, unfolding the architecture spatially is not feasible due to serious power and area issue arisen by complex interconnections.  the pipelined architectures are useful for ffts that require high data throughput.  the basic principle of pipelined architectures is to collapse the rows.  radix-2 multi - path delay commutator was probably the most classical approach for pipeline implementation of radix-2 fft algorithm.  disadvantages include an increase in area due to the addition of memories and delay which is related to the memory usage. in this paper, we propose a novel
