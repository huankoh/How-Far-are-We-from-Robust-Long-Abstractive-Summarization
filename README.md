## Human Annotation of Model-Generated Summaries
For now, we release the human annotation dataset **robust_long_abstractive_human_annotation_dataset.jsonl** (or **.csv**). We use this dataset for the metric comparison in section 5 of our work. 


|  **Data Field**  | **Definition** | 
| :--------: |:---- | 
|  **dataset**  | Whether the model-generated summary is from arXiv or GovReport dataset. | 
| **dataset_id** | ID_ + document ID of the dataset. To match the IDs with original datasets, please remove the "ID_" string. The IDs are from the original dataset of [arXiv](https://github.com/armancohan/long-summarization) and [GovReport](https://gov-report-data.github.io/). | 
|  **model_type**  | Model variant which generates the summary. 1K, 4K and 8K represents 1,024, 4096 and 8192 input token limit of the model. For more information, please refer to the original paper. | 
| **model_summary** | Model-generated summary | 
| **relevance** | Percentage of the reference summaryâ€™s main ideas contained in the generated summary. Higher = Better.| 
| **factual consistency** | Percentage of factually consistent sentences. Higher = Better. |


## Human Annotation of Model-Generated Factual Error Types
We are standardizing the data for detailed factual error types. Stay tuned!
